    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
      This website does not collect any personal data. It does save all you'r music data in an
      indexeddb, does not set any cookies and it does not use any third-party tracking scripts. No
      user analytics or other metrics are processed during your visit, and the server does not write
      any log files, which means your IP address is not stored anywhere.
    </p>
    <p>It’s a free piece of content, no strings attached.</p>
    <h2>Secure Data Transfer</h2>
    <p>
      This website transmits itself using HTTPS, encrypting all data between the browser and the
      server. Your network provider may still be able to see that you are loading files from this
      site, but not their content. This also protects you from third parties intercepting data e.g.
      while browsing on public Wi-Fi, or network providers injecting ads into this site.
